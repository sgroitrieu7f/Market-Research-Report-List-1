<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Sinus Dilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Balloon Sinus Dilation</li><li>No-Balloon Sinus Dilation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The sinus dilator market is categorized into two main types: balloon sinus dilation and no-balloon sinus dilation. Balloon sinus dilation involves the use of a catheter with an inflatable balloon that is inserted into the sinus passage, which is then expanded to open blocked sinus cavities. In contrast, no-balloon sinus dilation utilizes alternative devices or techniques, such as surgical tools, to relieve sinus obstructions without the use of a balloon mechanism, often focusing on direct intervention and removal of tissue.</p></p>
