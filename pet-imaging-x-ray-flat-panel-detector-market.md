<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pet Imaging X-ray Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion</li><li>Direct Conversion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PET imaging X-ray flat panel detector market is primarily categorized into two types: indirect conversion and direct conversion. Indirect conversion detectors use a two-step process where X-rays are first converted to light, and then to an electrical signal, often utilizing materials like cesium iodide. In contrast, direct conversion detectors convert X-rays directly into electrical signals, typically using materials like amorphous selenium. Each type offers distinct advantages in terms of image quality, efficiency, and application suitability in medical imaging.</p></p>
